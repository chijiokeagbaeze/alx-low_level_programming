Tasks
0-preprocessor
A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

1-compiler
A script that compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name was saved in the variable $CFILE and the output file was named the same as the C file, but with the extension.o instead of .c.

2-assembler
A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name was saved in the variable $CFILE and the output file was named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

3-name
A script that compiles a C file and creates an extension named cisfun. The C file name was saved in the variable $CFILE.

4-puts.c
A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. Used the function puts but did not use printf, and your program should end with the value 0.

5-printf.c
A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, followed by a new line. Used the function printf, did not use the function puts, my program returns 0, and my program compiles without warning when using the -wall gcc option.

6-size.c
A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. Produced the exact same output as in the example, warnings were not allowed, my program returns 0, and has to install libc-dev-i386 on my linux to test the -m32 gcc option.
